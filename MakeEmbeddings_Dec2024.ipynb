Behold the mighty army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arrayed for battle by your own gifted disciple, the son of Drupad.\"', '\"Behold in their ranks are many powerful warriors, like Yuyudhan, Virat, and Drupad, wielding mighty bows and equal in military prowess to Bheem and Arjun. \"', '\"There are also accomplished heroes like Dhrishtaketu, Chekitan, the gallant King of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Shaibya, all the best of men.\"', '\"In their ranks, they also have the courageous Yudhamanyu, the gallant Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi, who are all great warrior chiefs.\"', '\"O best of Brahmins, hear too about the principal generals on our side, who are especially qualified to lead. These I now recount unto you.\"', '\"There are personalities like yourself, Bheeshma, Karna, Kripa, Ashwatthama, Vikarn, and Bhurishrava, who are ever victorious in battle.\"', '\"Also, there are many other heroic warriors, who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. They are all skilled in the art of warfare, and equipped with various kinds of weapons.\"', '\"The strength of our army is unlimited and we are safely marshalled by Grandsire Bheeshma, while the strength of the Pandava army, carefully marshalled by Bheem, is limited.\"', '\"Therefore, I call upon all the generals of the Kaurava army now to give full support to Grandsire Bheeshma, even as you defend your respective strategic points.\"', '\"Then, the grand old man of the Kuru dynasty, the glorious patriarch Bheeshma, roared like a lion, and blew his conch shell very loudly, giving joy to Duryodhan.\"', '\"Thereafter, conches, kettledrums, bugles, trumpets, and horns suddenly blared forth, and their combined sound was overwhelming.\"', '\"Then, from amidst the Pandava army, seated in a glorious chariot drawn by white horses, Madhav and Arjun blew their Divine conch shells.\"', '\"Hrishikesh blew his conch shell, called Panchajanya, and Arjun blew the Devadutta. Bheem, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his mighty conch, called Paundra.\"', '\"King Yudhishthir, blew the Anantavijay, while Nakul and Sahadev blew the Sughosh and Manipushpak.\"', '\"The excellent archer and king of Kashi, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virat, and the invincible Satyaki,\"', '\"Drupad, the five sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed Abhimanyu, son of Subhadra, all blew their respective conch shells, O Ruler of the earth.\"', '\"The terrific sound thundered across the sky and the earth, and shattered the hearts of your sons, O Dhritarasthra.\"', '\"At that time, the son of Pandu, Arjun, who had the insignia of Hanuman on the flag of his chariot, took up his bow. Seeing your sons arrayed against him, O King, Arjun then spoke the following words to Shree Krishna.\"', '\"Arjun said: O Infallible One, please take my chariot to the middle of both armies,\"', '\"so that I may look at the warriors arrayed for battle, whom I must fight in this great combat.\"', '\"I desire to see those who have come here to fight on the side of the evil-minded son of Dhritarasthra, wishing to please him.\"', '\"Sanjay said: O Dhritarasthra, having thus been addressed by Arjun, the conqueror of sleep, Shree Krishna then drew the magnificent chariot between the two armies.\"', '\"In the presence of Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and all the other kings, Shree Krishna said: O Parth, behold these Kurus gathered here.\"', '\"There, Arjun could see stationed in both armies, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, cousins, sons, nephews, grand-nephews, friends, fathers-in-law, and well-wishers.\"', '\"Seeing all his relatives present there, Arjun, the son of Kunti, was overwhelmed with compassion, and with deep sorrow, spoke the following words.\"', '\"Arjun said: O Krishna, seeing my own kinsmen arrayed for battle here and intent on killing each other, my limbs are giving way and my mouth is drying up.\"', '\"My whole body shudders; my hair is standing on end.\"', '\"My bow, the Gandiv, is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over. My mind is in quandary and whirling in confusion; I am unable to hold myself steady any longer.\"', '\"O Krishna, killer of the Keshi demon, I only see omens of misfortune. I do not foresee how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle.\"', '\"O Krishna, I do not desire victory, kingdom, or the happiness accruing to it. Of what avail will be a kingdom, pleasures, or even life itself, \"', '\"when the very persons for whom we covet them, are standing before us for battle?\"', '\"Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, grandsons, fathers-in-law, grand-nephews, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen are present here, staking their lives and riches.\"', '\"O Madhusudan, I do not wish to slay them, even if they attack me. If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, what satisfaction will we derive from the dominion over the three worlds, what to speak of this Earth?\"', '\"O Maintainer of all living entities, what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarasthra? Even though they may be aggressors, sin will certainly come upon us if we slay them.\"', '\"Hence, it does not behoove us to kill our own cousins, the sons of Dhritarashtra, and friends. O Madhav (Krishna), how can we hope to be happy by killing our own kinsmen?\"', '\"Their thoughts are overpowered by greed and they see no wrong in annihilating their relatives or wreaking treachery upon friends.\"', '\"Yet, O Janardan (Krishna), why should we, who can clearly see the crime in killing our kindred, not turn away from this sin?\"', '\"When a dynasty is destroyed, its traditions get vanquished, and the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligion.\"', '\"With the preponderance of vice, O Krishna, the women of the family become immoral; and from the immorality of women, O descendent of Vrishni, unwanted progeny are born.\"', '\"An increase in unwanted children results in hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family. Deprived of sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall.\"', '\"Through the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted progeny, a variety of social and family welfare activities are ruined.\"', '\"O Janardan (Krishna), I have heard from the learned that those who destroy family traditions dwell in hell for an indefinite period of time.\"', '\"Alas! How strange it is that we have set our mind to perform this great sin with horrifying consequences. Driven by the desire for kingly pleasures, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen.\"', '\"It would be better if, with weapons in hand, the sons of Dhritarashtra kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield.\"', '\"Sanjay said: Speaking thus, Arjun cast aside his bow and arrows, and sank into the seat of his chariot, his mind in distress and overwhelmed with grief.\"', '\"Sanjay said: Seeing Arjun overwhelmed with pity, his mind grief-stricken, and his eyes full of tears, Shree Krishna spoke the following words.\"', '\"The Supreme Lord said: My dear Arjun, how has this delusion overcome you in this hour of peril?  It is not befitting an honorable person.  It leads not to the higher abodes, but to disgrace.\"', '\"O Parth, it does not befit you to yield to this unmanliness.  Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O vanquisher of enemies.\"', '\"Arjun said: O Madhusudan, how can I shoot arrows in battle on men like Bheeshma and Dronacharya, who are worthy of my worship, O destroyer of enemies?\"', '\"It would be better to live in this world by begging, than to enjoy life by killing these noble elders, who are my teachers. If we kill them, the wealth and pleasures we enjoy will be tainted with blood.\"', '\"We do not even know which result of this war is preferable for us -- conquering them or being conquered by them. Even after killing them we will not desire to live. Yet they have taken the side of the sons of Dhritarasthra, and now stand before us on the battlefield.\"', '\"I am confused about my duty, and am besieged with anxiety and faintheartedness. I am Your disciple, and am surrendered to You. Please instruct me for certain what is best for me.\"', '\"I can find no means of driving away this anguish that is drying up my senses. Even if I win a prosperous and unrivalled kingdom on the earth, or gain sovereignty like the celestial gods, I will be unable to dispel this grief.\"', '\"Sanjay said: Having thus spoken, Gudakesh, that chastiser of enemies, addressed Hrishikesh: \"Govind, I shall not fight,\" and became silent.\"', '\"O Dhritarashtra, thereafter, in the midst of both the armies, Shree Krishna smilingly spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjun.\"', '\"The Supreme Lord said: While you speak words of wisdom, you are mourning for that which is not worthy of grief. The wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.\"', '\"Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.\"', '\"Just as the embodied soul continuously passes from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the soul passes into another body. The wise are not deluded by this.\"', '\"O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives rise to fleeting perceptions of happiness and distress. These are non-permanent, and come and go like the winter and summer seasons. O descendent of Bharat, one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\"', '\"O Arjun, noblest amongst men, that person who is not affected by happiness and distress, and remains steady in both, becomes eligible for liberation.\"', '\"Of the transient there is no endurance, and of the eternal there is no cessation. This has verily been observed and concluded by the seers of the Truth, after studying the nature of both.\"', '\"That which pervades the entire body, know it to be indestructible. No one can cause the destruction of the imperishable soul.\"', '\"Only the material body is perishable; the embodied soul within is indestructible, immeasurable, and eternal. Therefore, fight, O descendent of Bharat.\"', '\"Neither of them is in knowledge -- the one who thinks the soul can slay and the one who thinks the soul can be slain. For truly, the soul neither kills nor can it be killed.\"', '\"The soul is neither born, nor does it ever die; nor having once existed, does it ever cease to be. The soul is without birth, eternal, immortal, and ageless. It is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.\"', '\"O Parth, how can one who knows the soul to be imperishable, eternal, unborn, and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?\"', '\"As a person sheds worn-out garments and wears new ones, likewise, at the time of death, the soul casts off its worn-out body and enters a new one.\"', '\"Weapons cannot shred the soul, nor can fire burn it. Water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it.\"', '\"The soul is unbreakable and incombustible; it can neither be dampened nor dried. It is everlasting, in all places, unalterable, immutable, and primordial.\"', '\"The soul is spoken of as invisible, inconceivable, and unchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.\"', '\"If, however, you think that the self is subject to constant birth and death, O mighty-armed Arjun, even then you should not grieve like this.\"', '\"Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable.\"', '\"O scion of Bharat, all created beings are unmanifest before birth, manifest in life, and again unmanifest on death. So why grieve?\"', '\"Some see the soul as amazing, some describe it as amazing, and some hear of the soul as amazing, while others, even on hearing, cannot understand it at all.\"', '\"O Arjun, the soul that dwells within the body is immortal; therefore, you should not mourn for anyone.\"', '\"Besides, considering your duty as a warrior, you should not waver. Indeed, for a warrior, there is no better engagement than fighting for upholding of righteousness.\"', '\"O Parth, happy are the warriors to whom such opportunities to defend righteousness come unsought, opening for them the stairway to the celestial abodes.\"', '\"If, however, you refuse to fight this righteous war, abandoning your social duty and reputation, you will certainly incur sin.\"', '\"People will speak of you as a coward and a deserter. For a respectable person, infamy is worse than death.\"', '\"The great generals who hold you in high esteem will think that you fled from the battlefield out of fear, and thus will lose their respect for you.\"', '\"Your enemies will defame and humiliate you with unkind words, disparaging your might. Alas, what could be more painful than that?\"', '\"If you fight, you will either be slain on the battlefield and go to the celestial abodes, or you will gain victory and enjoy the kingdom on earth. Therefore arise with determination, O son of Kunti, and be prepared to fight.\"', '\"Fight for the sake of duty, treating alike happiness and distress, loss and gain, victory and defeat. Fulfilling your responsibility in this way, you will never incur sin.\"', '\"Hitherto, I have explained to you Sankhya Yog, or analytic knowledge regarding the nature of the soul. Now listen, O Parth, as I reveal Buddhi Yog, or the Yog of Intellect. When you work with such understanding, you will be freed from the bondage of karma.\"', '\"Working in this state of consciousness, there is no loss or adverse result, and even a little effort saves one from great danger.\"', '\"O descendent of the Kurus, the intellect of those who are on this path is resolute, and their aim is one-pointed. But the intellect of those who are irresolute is many-branched.\"', '\"Those with limited understanding, get attracted to the flowery words of the Vedas, which advocate ostentatious rituals for elevation to the celestial abodes, and presume no higher principle is described in them.\"', '\"They glorify only those portions of the Vedas that please their senses, and perform pompous ritualistic ceremonies for attaining high birth, opulence, sensual enjoyment, and elevation to the heavenly planets.\"', '\"With their minds deeply attached to worldly pleasures and their intellects bewildered by such things, they are unable to possess the resolute determination for success on the path to God.\"', '\"The Vedas deal with the three modes of material nature, O Arjun. Rise above the three modes to a state of pure spiritual consciousness. Freeing yourself from dualities, eternally fixed in Truth, and without concern for material gain and safety, be situated in the self.\"', '\"Whatever purpose is served by a small well of water is naturally served in all respects by a large lake. Similarly, one who realizes the Absolute Truth also fulfills the purpose of all the Vedas.\"', '\"You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.\"', '\"Be steadfast in the performance of your duty, O Arjun, abandoning attachment to success and failure.

Such a great soul is indeed very rare.\"', '\"Those whose knowledge has been carried away by material desires surrender to the celestial gods. Following their own nature, they worship the devatas, practicing rituals meant to propitiate these celestial personalities.\"', '\"Whatever celestial form a devotee seeks to worship with faith, I steady the faith of such a devotee in that form.\"', '\"Endowed with faith, the devotee worships a particular celestial god and obtains the objects of desire. But in reality, I alone arrange these benefits.\"', '\"But the fruit gained by these people of little understanding is perishable. Those who worship the celestial gods go to the celestial abodes, while My devotees come to Me.\"', '\"The less intelligent think that I, the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, was formless earlier and have now assumed this personality. They do not understand the imperishable exalted nature of My personal form.\"', '\"I am not manifest to everyone, being veiled by My divine Yogmaya energy.

Therefore, at all times be situated in Yog (union with God).\"', '\"The yogis, who know this secret, gain merit far beyond the fruits of Vedic rituals, the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities.  Such yogis reach the Supreme Abode.\"', '\"The Supreme Lord said:  O Arjun, because you are not envious of Me, I shall now impart to you this very confidential knowledge and wisdom, upon knowing which you will be released from the miseries of material existence.\"', '\"This knowledge is the king of sciences and the most profound of all secrets.

I remain like a neutral observer, ever detached from these actions.\"', '\"Working under My direction, this material energy brings into being all animate and inanimate forms, O son of Kunti.  For this reason, the material world undergoes the changes (of creation, maintenance, and dissolution).\"', '\"When I descend in My personal form deluded persons are unable to recognize Me.  They do not know the divinity of My personality, as the Supreme Lord of all beings.\"', '\"Bewildered by the material energy, such persons embrace demoniac and atheistic views.  In that deluded state, their hopes for welfare are in vain, their fruitive actions are wasted, and their culture of knowledge is baffled.\"', '\"But the great souls, who take shelter of My divine energy, O Parth, know Me, Lord Krishna, as the origin of all creation.

I am immortality as well as death personified, O Arjun.  I am the spirit as well as matter.\"', '\"Those who are inclined to the fruitive activity described in the Vedas worship Me through ritualistic sacrifices.

            "\n",
            "df[\"col\"][row_indexer] = value\n",
            "\n",
            "Use `df.loc[row_indexer, \"col\"] = values` instead, to perform the assignment in a single step and ensure this keeps updating the original `df`.\n",
            "\n",
            "See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n",
            "\n",
            "  dfQ2[\"text\"][counter-1] = dfQ2[\"text\"][counter-1] + dfQ[\"Text\"][i]\n"
